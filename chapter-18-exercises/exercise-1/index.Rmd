##LINJIAMING 

I like myself

```{r example, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
numbers <- runif(1:100)
hist(numbers)
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers)  # save the mean

img_url <- "https://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/money/scams_fraud/2019/12/1140-puppy-sad.jpg"

img_mark <- paste0("![dog](",img_url,")")
```

The mean of the number happens to be **`r numbers_mean`**

`r img_mark`

```{r code_chunk}
print(numbers)
```



```{r other}
msg <- "**Hello WORLD**"
```
